# AdjustableLimitedWatershed
An ImageJ/FIJI plugin (GUI and headless available) that implements the watershed algorithm with a number of optional parameters. These include an adjustable tolerance, limiting the length of the lines created by the watershed algorithm, whether or not to restrict to black, gaussian smoothing, and the option to set an EDM threshold.
